Description:
  A study of jet production in association with W and Z bosons
  for a jet transverse momentum threshold of 30 GeV, using 36 pb^-1 of
  proton-proton collision data at 7 TeV cms energy has been done.
  The study includes the measurement of the normalized inclusive rates
  of jets produced, as well as the ratios of cross-sections and the first test
  of the Berends-Giele scaling at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV.
ToDo:
 - need to discuss with experts
